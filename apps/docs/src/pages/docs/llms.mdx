This page provides AI-friendly documentation formats that can be used by large language models (LLMs) to better understand and work with 11ui components.

## Available Formats

We provide two different formats of documentation optimized for AI consumption:

### llms.txt

A concise index format with links to individual component documentation. This format is ideal for:

- Quick reference and component discovery
- Integration with AI tools that need structured navigation
- Systems that work better with linked content

[See llms.txt](/llms.txt)

### llms-full.txt

A comprehensive format containing the complete documentation for all components in a single file. This format is ideal for:

- AI models that need full context in a single document
- Local processing and analysis
- Systems that work better with embedded content

[See llms-full.txt](/llms-full.txt)

## Usage

These files are automatically generated from the same MDX source files used for the website documentation, ensuring consistency and accuracy.

The documentation includes:

- Component descriptions and use cases
- Installation instructions
- Code examples and demos

Both formats are updated automatically when the documentation is built, so they always reflect the latest component information.
