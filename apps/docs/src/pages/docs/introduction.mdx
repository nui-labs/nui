description: "Beautiful, customizable components built with Base UI and Tailwind CSS"
---

This isn’t a standard component library. It’s a curated set of components that you can customize to fit your style.

You won’t install it through npm. Instead, you simply select the components you need and add them directly to your project.

Once included, each component is fully adaptable, letting you fine-tune it to meet your exact requirements.

## Why Base UI?

[Base UI](https://base-ui.com) offers unstyled, headless components with built-in accessibility. This makes it perfect for 9ui, allowing us to integrate Tailwind CSS without forcing any default design. It’s a clean foundation that stays lightweight, letting you adapt every detail to fit your exact needs.

## Is it production ready?

It’s built on Base UI, which is in alpha, so there may be changes in the future. However, I'm actively testing and refining it. If you’re comfortable with an early-stage library and ready to adapt as it matures, you can use it in production. Just ensure you perform your own checks and stay updated with any changes.

You can follow the development and updates of Base UI [here](https://base-ui.com/react/overview/releases).

## Why it's called 9ui?

The number **"9"** looks like the letter **"g"**. If you read **"9"** as **"g"**, it becomes **"gui"**, which stands for **"Graphical User Interface"**.

## Thank you

First of all, I would like to thank [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com) for the inspiration. I am grateful to everyone who uses 9ui, provides feedback, and helps me improve it. Thank you!
