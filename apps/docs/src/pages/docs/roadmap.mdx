We plan to add more components and features as Base UI continues to evolve, and 9ui will grow right alongside it.

Development isn’t just about adding new components. We’ll also improve existing ones and enhance their usability over time.

User feedback is incredibly valuable to us. To share your ideas or issues, feel free to open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/borabaloglu/9ui/issues) or reach out to [@borabalogluu](https://x.com/borabalogluu) on X.

There’s no strict deadline, but we do have features in the pipeline. To follow our active development, check out [roadmap](https://9ui.featurebase.app/roadmap) for real-time updates.
