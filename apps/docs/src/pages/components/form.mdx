## About

9ui utilizes [`react-hook-form`](https://react-hook-form.com/) to build efficient, flexible, and scalable forms. React Hook Form is a lightweight library that optimizes performance by minimizing re-renders and simplifying form state management.

Why React Hook Form?

- Performance: Uses uncontrolled components, reducing unnecessary re-renders.
- Easy Integration: Works seamlessly with controlled and uncontrolled inputs.
- Validation: Supports built-in validation and integrates with libraries like [`Zod`](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod).
- Minimal Boilerplate: Reduces the amount of code needed to handle form state and validation.

## Usage

```tsx title="Imports"
import {
  Form,
  FormControl,
  FormDescription,
  FormField,
  FormItem,
  FormLabel,
  FormMessage,
} from "@nui/core/form";
```

```tsx title="Anatomy"
<Form {...form}>
  <form onSubmit={form.handleSubmit(onSubmit)}>
    <FormField
      name="..."
      control="{...}"
      render={() => (
        <FormItem>
          <FormLabel>Label</FormLabel>
          <FormControl>{/* Input, Select, etc. */}</FormControl>
          <FormDescription>Description</FormDescription>
          <FormMessage />
        </FormItem>
      )}
    />
  </form>
</Form>
```
